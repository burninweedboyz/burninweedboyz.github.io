        <h3>Additional objectives for 2022</h3>
        <p>January 16, 2022</p>
        <p>
            So after some thought I’ve decided on some more abstract areas to improve on for
            this year. These are less concrete goals to improve mentally in certain areas.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Working on caring less about others opinions, thoughts, and feelings.</li>
            <li>Work on being more assertive and less passive and/or cautious</li>
            <li>Work on thinking less about myself and more about the task at hand</li>
            <li>Work on forgetting + downplaying “negative” events.</li>
            <li>Work on using logic + reason over emotion (“adult” brain vs. “child”
                brain)</li>
            <li>Work on controlling thoughts. Don’t let child brain overrun you with
                negative thoughts</li>
            <li>Work on distancing yourself from your thoughts. You can’t always control
                them, and you often don’t agree with them, so treat them as a product of
                the “child” brain, scared and emotional.</li>
        </ul>

            This will be a log to track the approaches that I do this year. The goal is to hit 50.
            An approach won’t count if it doesn’t last at least 30 seconds, but I may still
            log it.

                Talked with the lady who was the dental assistant during my appointment. I didn’t
                approach her in this case, but we talked throughout the appointment.
