	<p class="post-date">March 9, 2022</p>
	<p>Well my rec team lost in the first round of the playoffs, 85-113. They were the better team, no doubt about it.
	   They had this one guy who kept driving in and scoring. Also, they had this really tall guy, about 6'10'' or so.
	   We lost by 1 point to them the first time we played, but they didn't have that tall guy. That means the rec 
	   championship goal I set is going down as a failure. It's over ladies and gentlemen, lets go home!</p>

        <p class="post-date">January 16, 2022</p>
        <p>
            So after some thought I’ve decided on some more abstract areas to improve on for
            this year. These are less concrete goals to improve mentally in certain areas.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Working on caring less about others opinions, thoughts, and feelings.</li>
            <li>Work on being more assertive and less passive and/or cautious</li>
            <li>Work on thinking less about myself and more about the task at hand</li>
            <li>Work on forgetting + downplaying “negative” events.</li>
            <li>Work on using logic + reason over emotion (“adult” brain vs. “child”
                brain)</li>
            <li>Work on controlling thoughts. Don’t let child brain overrun you with
                negative thoughts</li>
            <li>Work on distancing yourself from your thoughts. You can’t always control
                them, and you often don’t agree with them, so treat them as a product of
                the “child” brain, scared and emotional.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="post-title">Approach Log 2022</p>
        <p class="post-date">January 9, 2022</p>
        <p>
            This will be a log to track the approaches that I do this year. The goal is to hit 50.
            An approach won’t count if it doesn’t last at least 30 seconds, but I may still
            log it. (Edit: Removed 30 sec req as mentioned in goals post)
        </p>
        <ol>

                <p>January 8, 2022</p>
                <p>
                    Talked with the lady who was the dental assistant during my appointment. I didn’t
                    approach her in this case, but we talked throughout the appointment.

                <p>
                    Approached girl on campus walking toward me after finishing my kebab in the park blocks. Asked her where
                    the train was and whether it went to Beaverton or not. She didn't know about the latter and was turning
                away/looking at her phone, so it ended. In total the conversation probably lasted about 15-30 seconds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Approached a girl who was on her laptop at the coffee shop Ava in Beaverton. The approach was a bit
                    uncalibrated as I didn't fully commit until I was right in front of her on the way out of the shop.
                    I just asked her about her laptop and if it was good quality or not. I let her know that I was looking
                    for a new laptop and wanted to see if hers was good. She didn't seem too interested so I ended it
                    after about 30 seconds.

            Overall the general theme of this book is to think from other people’s
            perspective. Talk about their interests, avoid hurting their feelings, boost
            their ego, make them feel important. The book also emphasizes to be genuine in
            these actions, don’t give fake compliments or interest. This would take some
            effort on your part, as you may not be interested in the person at fist
            glance. Some of the techniques in this book seem like they would rub people
            the wrong way despite them being genuine. Some people might see these
            techniques as buttering them up in the hope of getting them to do stuff.
            This is acknowledged by Dale, as he says these techniques won’t work for
            everyone. Overall it was a good read that will take some active practice of
            the techniques to see results from.

        <p class="post-title">Vacation Update</p>
        <p class="post-date">September 18, 2021</p>
        <p>
            It’s been over a month since the last update here. In that time I wrapped up
            my internship at Amazon. I also took a week and a half long trip to San Diego
            from September 3rd – 15th. The trip was enjoyable, but I also longed to return
            home throughout it. It didn’t start out great. First, the flight was delayed
            twice. Then there was a huge line for the rental car. Once I got the the
            front, I was ripped off by the rental car guy, having to pay twice for
            insurance and other fees. Then I had to figure out where to park. After that
            I had to figure out how to work the key and get into the room. Finally, I
            walked around the Gaslamp district, the cities nightlife area, and tried to
            find something to eat. I have to say, after this adventure, I’ve been turned
            off of nightlife aspirations. It’s just too loud for me.
        </p>
        <p>After that first day, things got better. I did several activities throughout such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visiting the Old Town area, the zoo, Caranardo (an island across from downtown)</li>
            <li>Visiting natural parks and monuments such as Cabrillo (lighthouse), Torrey Pines, Mission (Church), and Sunset Cliffs</li>
            <li>Snorkeling and kayaking in La Jolla Cove. There were leopard sharks here.</li>
            <li>Surfing at Pacific Beach</li>
            <li>Smoking a cigar at Mission Beach and visiting Belmont Park</li>
            <li>Fishing at Mission beach on a skipper boat. I finally caught one fish after moving to land fishing.</li>
            <li>Horseback riding and visiting the U.S. – Mexican border</li>
        </ul>
        <p>[29 images]</p>
        <p>
            Overall the area wasn’t bad. There was however, a large homeless population
            near the area I was staying. I was asked for money several times, twice I
            obliged. I gave one guy 5 dollars and another 3 dollars to get a meal at
            McDonalds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon my return I’m enjoying the break and trying to think of projects
            outside of work that I want to focus on in my twenties. Here are a few so
            far:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Become conversational in Farsi</li>
            <li>Keep progressing with my workout routine</li>
            <li>Get competent with women</li>
            <li>Travel at least a week every year to a new location</li>
            <li>Try some type of fighting such as boxing, karate, or mma</li>
            <li>Read books on a variety of non-fiction topics to gain knowledge about the world</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I’ve been studying Farsi consistently for a few months now. This one
            shouldn’t be too hard, as long as I stay disciplined and keep studying at
            least every other day. For my workout routine, I’ve slowed in my progress
            quite a bit, however as long as I’m doing hard workouts to keep in shape this
            one isn’t too big of a concern. I might even try lifting again in the future,
            who knows. Getting competent with women is probably the hardest one on here.
            I’ll have to cold approach, something I haven’t done yet. Right now I’m
            thinking of doing the indirect style from Roosh’s Day Bang book. I’ll do
            approaches in the grocery store, coffee shops, public transport, the mall,
            and the street. I think this style fits me better than direct. Also daygame
            fits me better than nightgame. As long as I put in consistent effort at this,
            I’ll live with the results. As for traveling, this shouldn’t be hard at all.
            I’ll pick locations based on brief research, and book the trip. The fighting
            one isn’t the most important to me. It seems like a good thing to be competent
            in, so I’ll look into trying this out. Finally, the book reading is important
            to gain a good knowledge about various topics while still young.
        </p>
        <p>
            Surely other projects will come up throughout my twenties, but if I complete
            these ones, I can say I made the most of my time and became a competent man.

        <p class="post-title">I'm back</p>
        <p class="post-date">August 12, 2021</p>
        <p>
            So it’s been a while. In fact, this is the first post of 2021. It’s been 8
            months since the last post. Not that anyone gives a shit anyways. So I’m
            graduating in a couple weeks. I should be getting an offer to join Amazon
            full time as well. However, I’m going to request a couple weeks off after
            finishing school. With this time, I’m taking my talents abroad. I haven’t
            determined where to go yet, however there are several favorites. I’m thinking
            about somewhere in the U.K., such as London. I’m also thinking about
            somewhere in Eastern Europe, such as Poland. Finally, South America has been
            recommended at Swooptheworld forum, so I might go there. During this time I
            will enjoy the sights, and also get laid. I’m going in there with no game
            experience, but I’m gonna make it happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from all that, I’m planning on moving out in the near future as well.
            There is no rush, but I’m considering whether to rent or buy a home. I’ll
            have to do some research on this later on. I’ve also been progressing on the
            Persian lessons at easypersian.com. Being conversational in Farsi is the goal.
            I don’t care as much about writing, but just being able to speak the language
            would be great, as my mom and her side of the family are all Persian. Well
            that’s all for today, here are some photos to keep you entertained.

        <p class="post-title">The Plan</p>
        <p class="post-date">December 7, 2020</p>
        <p>
            So here’s the plan. I’m on track to graduate with my Bachelors in the of
            summer 2021 (August). After this I’m going to move out of my parents basement
            as soon as possible. In fact, I’ll be planning the move as I’m finishing my
            degree. There are several priorities I have for where I will move to. First,
            it will be near my parents. I want to stay close to them so I can visit on a
            weekly basis. Second, it will be a super cheap studio place, as I don’t care
            about having a nice place, just a kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. Finally, I
            want to be close to the action in Portland, specifically the nightlife areas.
            I likely won’t be in the city, due to the cost, but right outside of it. I can
            take the train into the city. Starting late 2021 and into 2022, I’m gonna go
            out and build up a social life. I’m going to start chatting up women and gain
            some competence in that area. I’m also going to try and meet male friends that
            I can hang out with and potentially wing with while hitting on women. I’m
            almost 23 now, so this game journey will begin at 23/24 years old. From now
            until I graduate, I’ll focus on school, my internship, and keeping healthy and
            active.
