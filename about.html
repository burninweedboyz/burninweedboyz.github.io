            Hi, my name is Cyrus Rice. I'm just a young guy born and raised in the Pacific Northwest. As of now I've
            just finished college and started work full time for about 5 months. In my spare time I like to play basketball
            at the gym, do strength training, study Farsi, and watch shows with my family. This is a blog to record my
            thoughts, goals, etc... over time so that I can laugh at them later on. Enjoy the quality content.
        </p>
