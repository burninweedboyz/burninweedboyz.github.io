	    So I went to Kasa with Jordan. In the line there were several girls behind me that seemed open to conversation. One was getting close and apologized, 	      the other asked me what the cover was, and later asked for help with the atm. I think the lesson here is to just be social in the line, it doesn't need to be direct but just having a conversation. In the club Jordan opened a girl from behind and she was a bit closed off and startled, but he kept going and she warmed up. The lesson, persist past the initial opener even if she is cold. If she remains cold, eject. I tried to talk to a girl by touching her shoulder but she didn't turn. Jordan told me to talk to her in these situations, she might be shy or not sure if you're just trying to get by. I also had a girl in a mixed group open me by saying it was her friends b-day. I talked to them a bit but ran out of steam. I should've continued the conversation or possibly tried to dance with them since it seemed like they were higher energy. Also, I should've kept to conversation funny and goofy. I need to come up with some go-to funny conversation topics for these situations. Overall, the takeaway is to approach when seeing an ioi quickly, regardless of openers. I got a lot of ioi's and  chickened out.

	    The day before yesterday I went to Holocene solo for the 90s vs 00s dance night. I got many ioi's but just chickened out and danced the whole time. I just wasn't committed and shouldn't have gone out that night.
        </p>
	<p>
	    Yesterday I went to the Saturday market with Jordan for day game. We walked around a lot until I finally made an approach on these two girls talking on the sidewalk. I told them they looked nice and commented on their matching bags. I talked about the bags for a bit and then excused myself. After this I realized I just need to do this more, no technique analysis needed, simply get comfortable with it. I did one more approach, approaching these girls from behind as they were walking in front of us. I just sayed they looked nice and ejected since they seemed wierded out. Jordan mentioned I should've got in front of them to not startle them and show masculine presence, which makes sense. Jordan approached this girl who ended up being in highschool in front of the PSU engineering building :). 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Jordan and I went to Shake later after daygaming. It took us a while to start approaching. My first approach I approached this girl from behind and asked her why she was so hot. She actually made a few comments back even though she had no interest or ioi's. I'll definitely be using this opener more in the future. For my second approach I asked these two girls dancing why they were so hot again. They seemed to enjoy it and I could've gone further but a guy pulled them away. Before that, I started asking weird questions to be funny, which I might try again. Afterwards there was this girl with a big ass that I wanted to approach. I saw this guy just start grinding on her and she went with it, so I tried the same approach later. I don't like the feel of it, but it seems to work from my observation. I grabbed her waist but didn't make ass to crotch contact. She looked back and smiled, so I was good. We had made prior eye contact as well. I think I'm going to try this in the more meat market type clubs if I get some IOI's from the girl. Asking girls to dance verbally or by sticking my hand out hasn't gotten good responses, even from girls who gave me an IOI. I want to work on more assertive, primal, and non-verbal type of game. I think this is best for clubs.

	<p>
	    Jordan saw this girl there that he had almost banged doing gutter game at Shake a few weeks ago. She was pretty hot too, probably 7 or 8/10 looks wise. He had gone to her and her friends house and was about to seal the deal, when the friend shut it down. This night he hesitated to approach, and this other guy ended up dancing with her throughout the night. He did eventually approach, just to say hi and happy birthday. At the end that guy ended up leaving with her, or so it seemed. Jordan realized he should've just said screw it and tried to go for her or fail, and not worry about screwing up.

	    Tuesday I went with my buddy Ronit to a blues festival and fireworks show. Throughout the day I saw many cute girls but hesitated to approach because they were walking in a crowd or dancing. This was during the day and I only had 1 beer so it was more intimidating than a club or bar. In these situations I need to man up and just do it. Also, keeping it simple is key as I'm already nervous and can't think clear. Just saying hi your cute, or commenting on her appearance/making assumptions are the two easiest openers. The point is to just open with something no matter how bad, as it's better than passing it up. Also, I tried keeping eye contact with girls as long as possible and noticed that some would match me. I'm going to keep doing this in clubs. Wait for her to break the contact. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Friday I went to Shake by myself. I took a while to start dancing, looking at my phone and throwing back beers in the meantime. I got some ioi's but chickened out most of the night. I think for a club like Shake, if the girl is dancing then simply saying hi and then grabbing her hand and dancing is the way to go. I'll try this next time. I tried to just grab a girl's waist who was near me and she wasn't into it. I'm going to avoid this unless the girl gives clear ioi's or it works with another guy like last time. My highlight of the night was grinding with this hot black girl. She was dancing with her friends and threw me a few subtle looks. I moved closer to her and she eventually ended up in front of me, facing me. From there I just grabbed her hand, spun her, and started grinding. The last few times I've done this I just say nothing and eventually she leaves. From now on I'm going to try making conversation while dancing. Something like "I think you are trying to seduce me with your moves". Either that or reopen her later, as she is somewhat interested in me.

	    Saturday I went to Jackies with Ronit. He left after a while and I just rolled solo the rest of the night. I opened 4 girls, in some commenting on their clothing/tattoos and in others jsut saying hi and slipping into have you been here before boring talk. The thing is, that's better than nothing. In those cases I just opened without anything in my mind. I'm going to try a set bar/club opener in these situations so I don't freeze, something that works in all bars/clubs. So the first girl I opened by asking about her tatoos. We talked about common areas for tatoos, most painful areas for them, and worst areas for them. The conversation died off after that. I could've asked how she planned/chose the tattoos and why. I could've assumed she worked in a creative field because of them. I could've assumed she doesn't like me because I don't have tattoos and teased on that. Another thing is there were a few clear ioi's that I failed to act on. Remember, just use a canned opener or say hi, better than nothing.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The second girl I opened by saying her jean jacked looked cool. We talked about the venue and other venues, getting into where I/she lived. Here I could've assumed she worked on a ranch and milked cows. I could've asked why she was in a bar with city-boys. Or simply use a canned opener.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The third girl I opened while she was on her phone. Bad move on my part. The fourth girl I opened by saying hi and moving into boring talk. Here I could've used a canned opener or just said hey your cool I had to say what's up, then maybe tell her I don't know what else to say and reapproach later.

	    Yesterday I went to the White Owl and then the Goodfoot. White Owl was pretty quite, nobody on the dancefloor and groups at tables. This was Friday around 10-11:30 so maybe it picks up later.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Scenario 1: At Goodfoot as I entered the dance floor I immeditely noticed a girl in a circle looking back at me frequently. I chickened out but what I should've done is try to make eye contact with a smile. After this, I should most likely move to her side and open her normally. I haven't had luck with dance approaches so I'll limit those, unless it's obvious she wanted to grind for example.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Scenario 2: There were several situations where girls in groups who were dancing were shooting me looks. This situation happens all the time on the dancefloor. I think the way to handle this is to make eye contact with the girl I like, smile, and approach her and open from the side/front (not behind!). I can essentially "join the circle" and even dance with them after opening her. This is tough when she is far away or blocked though. In these situations I can wait until she gets a drink, or just work my way over there.  
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 1: I approached this girl who was off the dance floor alone. I used the "You looking like you're having the most fun" opener and it fit since she looked bored. After this we talked about the music a bit, but I couldn't hear her well so I was just nodding. I should've used some of my canned conversations to keep it more entertaining. She looked uninterested so I left. Shortly after she came over and asked if I wanted her number. She was replying to my texts late at night so I tried to go for the ONS, but she didn't reply after that. I guess with a connection that weak I should've just asked her out on a date. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 2: I approached another girl off the dance floor with the same opener. This opener seems to get decent reception. We talked about the music and dancing again. I talked about how bad dancers need a crowded dance floor to hide and the opposite for good dancers. I should say that I need a crowded dance floor so nobody gets jealous of my skills. For this approach I should've gone into some canned conversations. I ejected and saw her with a guy later so maybe she ahd a bf.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 3: I saw a girl in a group nearby who I think was looking back and getting close. I opened her from behind with a dance approach. She turned it down but seemed interested. For this I should've just done a regular open. Tonight made me realize I need to banish the dance approach for most cases for the time being. I could've also reapproached her.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 4: There was a girl dancing with her friend and getting really close in front of me. I tried to dance open her from behind, and she gave a dirty look. She danced with me seemingly out of pity after that, trying to give tips on how I should dance better. This is my most embarrassing approach to date. I should've opened from the side verablly and possibly joined their dance group afterwards. This approach made me realize I need to STOP APPROACHING FROM BEHIND AND/OR DOING DANCING APPROACHES. Also, if I'm going to approach I need to do I quickly instead of creepily hovering near her. Just use a canned opener and do your best.
