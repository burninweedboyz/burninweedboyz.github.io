        <p class="post-title">Return From Hiatus</p>
        <p class="post-date">September 18, 2022</p>
        <p>
	        So I'm back after an absence of 4 and a half months. To be honest, I decided to end this blog around June due
            to a lack of interest on my part. I got sick in May right after the previous post. This was the worst illness
            I've ever had. There was about 2 weeks of pretty harsh sore throat, fever, nausea, etc... On top of that,
            however, was an extended depression, anxiety and lack of energy for another 2 weeks. This was the worst part,
            as I had no desire to do anything and felt a sense of dread and anxiety when not around family. I've never had
            anything like that before, and hopefully never do again. If that is what true depression is like, then that
            would be a hellish existence.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that sickness, we went to Illinois to visit family and friends. We visited my mom's brothers family and
            stayed at their house. We also visited several friends/family of my dad who lived around the area. During this
            trip I got the inspiration to start some hobbies/side projects when returning. For one, I started volunteering
            at Habitat for Humanity to learn home building skills and also help out of course. Second, I started boxing
            at West Portland Boxing fitness classes. I'm thinking of joining the team to do sparring and amateur fights.
            Finally, I started hitting bars around the area in hopes of meeting women and just getting over the fear in
            general. So far I've hit 5 of them, Loyal Legion (Gin & Tonic), Ickabods (Vodka Cranberry), Brickyard Tavern
            (Corona), Driftwood Room (Jack & Coke), and Broadway Saloon (Bud Light). I had to hype myself up a lot prior
            to going into these bars, but it's good to get over the fear. As far as meeting women, it's definitely not my
            ideal environment, but if I go once in a while I might see some cute girls to talk to.
        </p>
        <p>
            So now for the women part. I slacked off after dropping the 50 approach goal. Only recently I've decided to
            add back in a goal to approach a girl a week. Without goals I tend to just drift around aimlessly so from now
            on I'm gonna keep the goals. The main priority is to just get out of the house and be a social, friendly guy.
            However, I need the goal in the background to force me to make progress. For example, on Friday I forced my
            self to walk around downtown after work until I made an approach. Without this goal, I would've given up. It
            took me almost 2 hours to do it as well. So to summarize, the approach log is back on. Fifty for the year is
            still the goal. The method doesn't matter, as long as I approach a girl outside of a customer service setting
            and open my mouth. I've got some notes for locations to hit and how often, which I'll add in a new section.
            The main idea is that I can hit bars/clubs, the street, shops/mall, coffee shop, social circle.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the main goal is to just work on these projects and log efforts here. I'll be more active here from now on,
            guaranteed or your money back.

        <p class="post-date">May 1, 2022</p>
        <p>
            So I must confess, April was a bit of a downer month for me. I slacked off in most areas and had a bit of a
            change in direction. I'm going to drop the 50 approach goal, along with the get laid goal. These goals just
            give me the wrong mindset and I'm not sure that's top priority for me anyhow. Instead I'm just going to focus
            on being social and friendly. If I see a girl a like and in a reasonable situation, I will approach her of
            course. I'm not giving up on women or anything like that, simply focusing on getting better in terms of
            confidence, social skills, etc and the women will be a side affect of that. Instead of approaching just to
            reach 50, where I usually just ask for the train and bail, I'll approach when I see a probable situation and
            focus on having a friendly conversation with a bit of flirting and asking for her number at the end. The goal
            isn't to get laid, just have a nice conversation with a cute girl. My hope is I will stress about approaching
            less and instead approach in better situations, as well as have an actual conversation instead of ending after
            10 seconds. Because of these changes, my new goal is to simply get a girl out on a date. In addition to this,
            I want to take every solid oppurtunity to approach when they come. Today a girl at the coffee shop asked if
            my notebook was a Harry Potter book because of its cover. I should have continued this conversation and asked
            for her number. Those are the situations where I've got to be better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also worth noting, this May I'm focusing on thinking less and taking more action. Basically when in doubt,
            just do something, regardless of what that is. Today I went to Big Al's and played pool by myself after
            ordering a Jack and Coke. I had been wanting to order a drink at a bar just to get comfortable with it, but
            today I finally said screw it and did it. That's the spirit, just do it. It was 11 bucks, so I can't say that
            I'll be doing that again anytime soon. However, now I can comfortably order a drink at a bar if I'm going with
            friends or a date. A simple action has taken SOME of the fear out of going to bars.

        <p class="post-date">April 17, 2022</p>
        <p>
            You might not be clear on what you want to do in life. You might not have a passion. The key, however, is to
            keep moving. Take action, no matter how small or in what area the action applies to. All the other contemplations
            are just overcomplicating this. Break it down to the base level, which is to take action in REAL LIFE, not
            online, not by reading about something.

        <p>
            Yesterday I hit 10 approaches, 20% of the way there. So far, almost all of them have been very short
            conversations, mostly me asking where something is and them telling me. For the next 10, I want to focus on
            two things. First, I'm gonna do 5 direct and 5 indirect approaches. The direct ones can start off complimenting
            her in some way, London Daygame style. Second, I want at least 3 of these approaches to lead to a number or
            rejection. It's time to get some live feedback. Without this constraint, I'll lazily keep doing short
            conversations and ending when it gets uncomfortable. The whole point of these approaches is to date girls, so
            you have to make that clear by flirting and asking for her number. Approaching 50 girls asking for the train
            and then leaving won't do anything for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Direct[WIP]: Compliment her clothing/items, guess her job/what's shes doing/ethnicity -> Playful Observation/why
            you like it -> build on this/ramble ->
        </p>
        <p>
            Indirect: ask about where to find something, one of her items -> ask details/explain why you need to know ->
            shift to asking her name/job/location -> ask to hang out sometime and number close

        <p>
            Anyhow, this past Sunday I went with my dad and brother to the mountains. We hit the slopes for some snow
            boarding. Everyone's getting better, we just don't go enough. We typically go once a year, 2 if lucky. I
            think 2 is a good frequency for making progress. It gets fun when you warm up enough to start hitting the
            blue hills. I managed to get the turning down a lot better so that now I just barely turn side to side,
            resembling more of a wave like this ~. The sharp turning causes you to fall a lot more.
        </p>
        <p>
            This weekend I'm planning on getting some new button downs from the mall. I think we all know what follows.
            I will be getting several approaches done this weekend, as I haven't done any since the ones almost two weeks
            ago. Especially at the mall. The goal is to ask for at least one girls number, results be damned.

        <p class="post-title">Learning and Unlearning Habits</p>
        <p class="post-date">March 27, 2022</p>
        <p>
            After talking with my mom the topic of neuron connections came up. We were discussing how memories are simply
            a sequence of connections between adjacent neurons. Remembering a certain event lights up this path and
            strengthens it. I think it's much the same with skills and habits. Learning a new skill or starting a new
            habit works certain pathways. It is hard at first, because these pathways are weakly formed. Learning is the
            process of strengthening these pathways until it is easy, then moving on to more difficult tasks. Thinking of
            everything in this way, we gain a few insights. First, quitting bad habits will get easier, but will be hard
            in the beginning, as the paths are strong and hard to resist. Almost auto pilot mode. With time and discipline,
            the paths get weaker and soon the bad habit is much easier to resist. Also, things that are scary at first
            will get easier and not so scary after repetitions as well. Keep this in mind when overwhelmed by getting
            started. It won't be this hard for long, otherwise nobody would do it. Just plough through the beginners hell.

            So today we had the family over. Grandma, aunt, their husbands, cousins, their husbands, and one kid. It had
            been a while since We'd seen our aunt and cousins, over 2 years in fact, so that was nice.

        <p>
            I hit 3 approaches today, an all time high. None of them went anywhere however. While walking around Pioneer
            Square I felt the same sense of tension and weirdness that I did when walking around Gaslamp the first night
            in San Diego. It feels like a sensory overload, the act of being overwhelmed by the amount of noise and people
            all around you. While I don't want to rule out nightgame and nightlife stuff, I'm definitely not suited for it.
            Part of it is going solo, as nightlife is meant to be enjoyed with friends, it's odd to go alone. However,
            for me sticking to day time street approaches along with cafes, malls, grocery stores, etc is the way to go.
            Especially as a nervous guy with no experience with women, you don't want to make it harder than it needs to
            be. Fit it to your lifestyle, don't fit your lifestyle to it.

        <p class="post-title">Make The Most of Each Approach</p>
        <p class="post-date">March 22, 2022</p>
        <p>
            My lifestyle doesn't involve a lot of interaction with women. I work from home Monday - Thursday, so I only
            go to the office on Fridays. The office is in downtown Portland, near the PSU campus. This is therefore my
            golden day for getting at least one approach in. Other than work, I go to the gym a couple times a week to
            play basketball. There aren't a lot of women in the weight area, and I'd have to approach while heading to
            the bathroom. I also go the coffee shop several times per week. Approaching here is a bit tougher, and options
            are often limited. I'm not into night game much, so the primary option would be to go downtown for work more
            often. Here I could hit the PSU campus, any malls, the streets, cafes, etc... I could also hit the Washington
            Square Mall once in a while. Anyhow, I'm getting off track here. The point is, with limited approaches, I've
            got to take each approach further. This doesn't mean treat it super serious and that you must get the number
            or it is a fail. It simply means do not eject until you have asked for her number if she is not giving signs
            that she isn't interested or wants to leave. She doesn't have to be showing interest, just not showing
            disinterest. It might get a bit awkward, but that's alright.

        <p class="post-title">Win The Day</p>
        <p class="post-date">March 22, 2022</p>
        <p>
            One thing I've begun to think about a bit more is winning the day. I struggle with keeping disciplined through
            out the day regarding eating healthy, staying off the internet, getting to bed early, and not jerking off.
            I tend to lose the willpower to resist these temptations later in the day. All I want is one bowl of ice cream.
            The problem is, once I succumb, then I mentally go "screw it, you've already screwed up today, might as well
            just start over tomorrow". What usually follows is me eating everything in sight, jerking off, and staying up
            late on the internet. The problem is that this is aa faulty way of thinking. You aren't a robot, so you're
            going to have vices and partake in them once in a while. You can't look at each day as either win or lose,
            instead you have to do the best you can each day. Think of it like a 1-10 score. You want to get the highest
            score on each day. So if you eat ice cream, bringing the score from 10 to 9, why would you eat another bowl
            and jerk off, bringing it down to 7? To give another example, lets say in one month Bob gets a few 3/4/5/10
            days, bunch of 6/10 days, a bunch of 7/10's, a few 8/10's. Let's say he averages 6.5/10 over the month. Jim,
            on the other hand, gets a few 9/10's, a few 10/10's, and a bunch of 3/4/5/10's. Jim averages 5/10. In this
            case, Bob comes out with the best average, and that's the goal. So the idea is to do the best each day and
            not tank after losing a point or two on a given day. Play the long game, don't aim for perfection, just a
            solid average over a long period of time. To wrap this up, I'll end with a good analogy I read on this topic.
            If you were hit in the back by another car, you wouldn't say screw it and drive over a cliff right?

            On the way to the coffee shop I was nearly murdered. This guy was in the left lane. I was in the right lane,
            accelerating past him. Right when I got side by side, he began a lane change. I had to swerve into the bike
            lane and accelerate to get out of the danger zone. I thought I was getting hit for sure, when we were side
            by side I looked over and his car looked like it was a few inches away from bashing into mine. That would've
            been the third accident I've been in, all the fault of the other driver.

        <p class="post-title">Thoughts and Updates</p>
        <p class="post-date">March 13, 2022</p>
        <p>
            So just some updates here. I'm gonna start posting about events that I attend such as the Batman movie post.
            This will be good for looking back on and reminiscing about later on when I'm a senile old man. On that note,
            this past Thursday (March 10 2022), I went to a team lunch with my coworkers at the Burmese Bistro Royale in
            Beaverton. Several people from our team are leaving and this was a send off lunch for them. The beef curry
            that I had was quite good. Also, on Friday I usually go to the office to get out of the house. This past
            Friday one of my coworkers was in the office. He is from Seattle but flew down for our lunch on Thursday. We
            chatted throughout the day and grabbed lunch at the food carts, like I usually do. It was a bit odd since I'm
            used to being the only one in the office.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, I'm going to start forcing myself to do at least one approach per week. This will insure that I don't
            make excuses and wind up in October with 30 more to go. So far I've only done 3, so I've got to get on it.
            The key thing I need to remember is to just approach with some made up question, not worrying about how to
            sustain the conversation. I think the worry about what to talk about keeps me from approaching. This way,
            the only goal is to simply open my mouth and get the girl to open her mouth in return. I think that is at
            least half of the battle. After that, I can try and prolong the conversation. Another think is that if a girl
            likes me, she will likely make some attempt to keep it going as well. So even if I have no seduction skills
            (which I don't), simply approaching gives you a higher chance of running into a girl who likes you out of
            sheer luck. It's a numbers game, and the best way to succeed as a novice is to simply put yourself in more
            conversations with women.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thought I had today is that in order to make friends and meet women, simply being a friendly, cheer
            ful guy will go a long way. The vibe you give off is contagious, and people will want to be around you. You
            make others day, and feel good about yourself. It's a rare win-win situation. Nobody wants to be around the
            guy who never smiles, has closed-off body language, and doesn't make an effort in conversations. This is what
            I did in high school and college. I've gotten better, but still do quite a bit of this even today. One big
            area that will help in this is cleaning up my diet and sleeping habits. These habits have a snowball effect
            that boosts everything else.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also on that note, taking more opportunities to socialize is a good idea. People you talk to and ask about
            their hobbies might later invite you to hang out or do an activity or vice versa. The key is to take an
            interest in them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyhow, a bit of a long winded post. We're closing out the first quarter of 2022. For the next few months I'm
            just going to focus on doing the approaches, keeping disciplined with diet, sleep, work, exercise, persian
            lessons, and being more friendly and social. Updates will be posted as usual. Stay thirsty my friends.

        <p class="post-date">March 12, 2022</p>
        <p>
            I just saw the new batman movie with my family. Going in I was expecting it to be tolerablle at best. It
            turned out to be a good movie though. Not at the level of the Christian Bale series, but still well worth
            going to the theater for. It had a good plot, with riddler serving as the main villain. As they usually do,
            at the end they teased a sequel with the joker. Based on how good this one was, I'll definitely go when
            that one comes out.

        Well my rec team lost in the first round of the playoffs, 85-113. They were the better team, no doubt about it.
	   They had this one guy who kept driving in and scoring. Also, they had this really tall guy, about 6'10'' or so.
	   We lost by 1 point to them the first time we played, but they didn't have that tall guy. That means the rec

            So after some thought I’ve decided on some more abstract areas to improve on for

        <ul>
            <li>Working on caring less about others opinions, thoughts, and feelings.</li>
            <li>Work on being more assertive and less passive and/or cautious</li>
            <li>Work on thinking less about myself and more about the task at hand</li>
            <li>Work on forgetting + downplaying “negative” events.</li>
            <li>Work on using logic + reason over emotion (“adult” brain vs. “child”
                brain)</li>
            <li>Work on controlling thoughts. Don’t let child brain overrun you with
                negative thoughts</li>
            <li>Work on distancing yourself from your thoughts. You can’t always control
                them, and you often don’t agree with them, so treat them as a product of
                the “child” brain, scared and emotional.</li>

        <p class="post-title">Approach Log 2022</p>
        <p class="post-date">January 9, 2022</p>
        <p>
            This will be a log to track the approaches that I do this year. The goal is to hit 50.
            An approach won’t count if it doesn’t last at least 30 seconds, but I may still
            log it. (Edit: Removed 30 sec req as mentioned in goals post)

                    Talked with the lady who was the dental assistant during my appointment. I didn’t
                    approach her in this case, but we talked throughout the appointment.

                <p>
                    Approached girl on campus walking toward me after finishing my kebab in the park blocks. Asked her where
                    the train was and whether it went to Beaverton or not. She didn't know about the latter and was turning
                away/looking at her phone, so it ended. In total the conversation probably lasted about 15-30 seconds.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>March 3, 2022</p>
                <p>
                    Approached a girl who was on her laptop at the coffee shop Ava in Beaverton. The approach was a bit
                    uncalibrated as I didn't fully commit until I was right in front of her on the way out of the shop.
                    I just asked her about her laptop and if it was good quality or not. I let her know that I was looking
                    for a new laptop and wanted to see if hers was good. She didn't seem too interested so I ended it
                    after about 30 seconds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was nervous as hell during this approach. I was sitting at a big table with 2 girls across from me.
                    I sat there with approaching them in mind. When they were talking about leaving, I summond the might
                    of Zeus and asked the closer girl to watch my stuff while I went to the bathroom. When I got back I
                    thanked her. For this one I knew I was going to chicken out if I tried to start a conversation about
                    her laptop or phone. It's better to get an approach, no matter how short, than none at all. At least
                    I'm getting towards my required 50 and also getting over the fear of approaching. I need to step up
                    the frequency on these though, with at least one a week, two preferred.

                <p>
                    I was trolling around the PSU campus for this one. I grabbed my lunch from the food carts and ate in
                    the park blocks area. Afterwards, I walked around looking for a girl to approach. I chickened out on
                    a few of them, but finally approached this girl sitting outside the campus starbucks. I did my usual
                    routine of pretending to be a moron and asking where the train is. This girl was definitely willing
                    to talk, so I should have pushed further. She recommended I take the bus, and we talked about where
                    we were commuting from for a bit. I should have asked more about train vs. bus vs. car. After this,
                    I could've asked about her student experience, and then number closed. However, this was by far my
                    longest and best approach thus far, so good work.
                </p>

                <p>March 25, 2022</p>
                <p>
                    I just got off the train at 10 in the morning for this one. Saw this girl alone looking at her phone,
                    so I decided to ask her where the PSU campus was. She didn't know, so that was it.

                    After eating lunch on the PSU campus, I walked around looking for a girl to approach like a psycho.
                    I ended up asking a girl who was about to cross as I was finished crossing, so it was a bit
                    uncalibrated. Also, she didn't pick up that I was trying to get her attention until she was a few
                    steps past me. I need to make eye contact earlier and stronger, and also say excuse me louder. For
                    this one she gave a general direction to go for the train but was from out of town, and therefore
                    didn't know where anything was located. For this one I could've talked about how confusing the train
                    system is, how she gets around, what she does, and finally where she is from. I was talking to her in
                    the street so it was a lost cause anyhow.

                <p>
                    After work I was walking around the Pioneer Square area and saw a girl outside a shop. I had to walk
                    back and sell the confused tourist bit before asking her where the train was. Another one from out
                    of town who didn't know anything. I could've used the same next steps as the approach above.

                <p>
                    Approached a salesgirl at the mall asking if they sold coats. I just wanted to get an approach done
                    since I was rapidly losing energy and confidence walking around the mall solo.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Asked the girl behind me if she could watch my stuff. I could've started a conversation on the way
                    out about one of her items. She seemed to smile at me a few times, so there may have been something
                    there.

            Overall the general theme of this book is to think from other people’s
            perspective. Talk about their interests, avoid hurting their feelings, boost
            their ego, make them feel important. The book also emphasizes to be genuine in
            these actions, don’t give fake compliments or interest. This would take some
            effort on your part, as you may not be interested in the person at fist
            glance. Some of the techniques in this book seem like they would rub people
            the wrong way despite them being genuine. Some people might see these
            techniques as buttering them up in the hope of getting them to do stuff.
            This is acknowledged by Dale, as he says these techniques won’t work for
            everyone. Overall it was a good read that will take some active practice of
            the techniques to see results from.

        <p class="post-title">Vacation Update</p>
        <p class="post-date">September 18, 2021</p>
        <p>
            It’s been over a month since the last update here. In that time I wrapped up
            my internship at Amazon. I also took a week and a half long trip to San Diego
            from September 3rd – 15th. The trip was enjoyable, but I also longed to return
            home throughout it. It didn’t start out great. First, the flight was delayed
            twice. Then there was a huge line for the rental car. Once I got the the
            front, I was ripped off by the rental car guy, having to pay twice for
            insurance and other fees. Then I had to figure out where to park. After that
            I had to figure out how to work the key and get into the room. Finally, I
            walked around the Gaslamp district, the cities nightlife area, and tried to
            find something to eat. I have to say, after this adventure, I’ve been turned
            off of nightlife aspirations. It’s just too loud for me.
        </p>
        <p>After that first day, things got better. I did several activities throughout such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visiting the Old Town area, the zoo, Caranardo (an island across from downtown)</li>
            <li>Visiting natural parks and monuments such as Cabrillo (lighthouse), Torrey Pines, Mission (Church), and Sunset Cliffs</li>
            <li>Snorkeling and kayaking in La Jolla Cove. There were leopard sharks here.</li>
            <li>Surfing at Pacific Beach</li>
            <li>Smoking a cigar at Mission Beach and visiting Belmont Park</li>
            <li>Fishing at Mission beach on a skipper boat. I finally caught one fish after moving to land fishing.</li>
            <li>Horseback riding and visiting the U.S. – Mexican border</li>
        </ul>
        <p>[29 images]</p>
        <p>
            Overall the area wasn’t bad. There was however, a large homeless population
            near the area I was staying. I was asked for money several times, twice I
            obliged. I gave one guy 5 dollars and another 3 dollars to get a meal at
            McDonalds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon my return I’m enjoying the break and trying to think of projects
            outside of work that I want to focus on in my twenties. Here are a few so
            far:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Become conversational in Farsi</li>
            <li>Keep progressing with my workout routine</li>
            <li>Get competent with women</li>
            <li>Travel at least a week every year to a new location</li>
            <li>Try some type of fighting such as boxing, karate, or mma</li>
            <li>Read books on a variety of non-fiction topics to gain knowledge about the world</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I’ve been studying Farsi consistently for a few months now. This one
            shouldn’t be too hard, as long as I stay disciplined and keep studying at
            least every other day. For my workout routine, I’ve slowed in my progress
            quite a bit, however as long as I’m doing hard workouts to keep in shape this
            one isn’t too big of a concern. I might even try lifting again in the future,
            who knows. Getting competent with women is probably the hardest one on here.
            I’ll have to cold approach, something I haven’t done yet. Right now I’m
            thinking of doing the indirect style from Roosh’s Day Bang book. I’ll do
            approaches in the grocery store, coffee shops, public transport, the mall,
            and the street. I think this style fits me better than direct. Also daygame
            fits me better than nightgame. As long as I put in consistent effort at this,
            I’ll live with the results. As for traveling, this shouldn’t be hard at all.
            I’ll pick locations based on brief research, and book the trip. The fighting
            one isn’t the most important to me. It seems like a good thing to be competent
            in, so I’ll look into trying this out. Finally, the book reading is important
            to gain a good knowledge about various topics while still young.
        </p>
        <p>
            Surely other projects will come up throughout my twenties, but if I complete
            these ones, I can say I made the most of my time and became a competent man.

            So it’s been a while. In fact, this is the first post of 2021. It’s been 8
            months since the last post. Not that anyone gives a shit anyways. So I’m
            graduating in a couple weeks. I should be getting an offer to join Amazon
            full time as well. However, I’m going to request a couple weeks off after
            finishing school. With this time, I’m taking my talents abroad. I haven’t
            determined where to go yet, however there are several favorites. I’m thinking
            about somewhere in the U.K., such as London. I’m also thinking about
            somewhere in Eastern Europe, such as Poland. Finally, South America has been
            recommended at Swooptheworld forum, so I might go there. During this time I
            will enjoy the sights, and also get laid. I’m going in there with no game
            experience, but I’m gonna make it happen.

            Aside from all that, I’m planning on moving out in the near future as well.
            There is no rush, but I’m considering whether to rent or buy a home. I’ll
            have to do some research on this later on. I’ve also been progressing on the
            Persian lessons at easypersian.com. Being conversational in Farsi is the goal.
            I don’t care as much about writing, but just being able to speak the language
            would be great, as my mom and her side of the family are all Persian. Well
            that’s all for today, here are some photos to keep you entertained.

        <p class="post-title">The Plan</p>
        <p class="post-date">December 7, 2020</p>
        <p>
            So here’s the plan. I’m on track to graduate with my Bachelors in the of
            summer 2021 (August). After this I’m going to move out of my parents basement
            as soon as possible. In fact, I’ll be planning the move as I’m finishing my
            degree. There are several priorities I have for where I will move to. First,
            it will be near my parents. I want to stay close to them so I can visit on a
            weekly basis. Second, it will be a super cheap studio place, as I don’t care
            about having a nice place, just a kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. Finally, I
            want to be close to the action in Portland, specifically the nightlife areas.
            I likely won’t be in the city, due to the cost, but right outside of it. I can
            take the train into the city. Starting late 2021 and into 2022, I’m gonna go
            out and build up a social life. I’m going to start chatting up women and gain
            some competence in that area. I’m also going to try and meet male friends that
            I can hang out with and potentially wing with while hitting on women. I’m
            almost 23 now, so this game journey will begin at 23/24 years old. From now
            until I graduate, I’ll focus on school, my internship, and keeping healthy and
            active.
