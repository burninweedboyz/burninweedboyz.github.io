	    So I went to Kasa with Jordan. In the line there were several girls behind me that seemed open to conversation. One was getting close and apologized, 	      the other asked me what the cover was, and later asked for help with the atm. I think the lesson here is to just be social in the line, it doesn't need to be direct but just having a conversation. In the club Jordan opened a girl from behind and she was a bit closed off and startled, but he kept going and she warmed up. The lesson, persist past the initial opener even if she is cold. If she remains cold, eject. I tried to talk to a girl by touching her shoulder but she didn't turn. Jordan told me to talk to her in these situations, she might be shy or not sure if you're just trying to get by. I also had a girl in a mixed group open me by saying it was her friends b-day. I talked to them a bit but ran out of steam. I should've continued the conversation or possibly tried to dance with them since it seemed like they were higher energy. Also, I should've kept to conversation funny and goofy. I need to come up with some go-to funny conversation topics for these situations. Overall, the takeaway is to approach when seeing an ioi quickly, regardless of openers. I got a lot of ioi's and  chickened out.

	    The day before yesterday I went to Holocene solo for the 90s vs 00s dance night. I got many ioi's but just chickened out and danced the whole time. I just wasn't committed and shouldn't have gone out that night.
        </p>
	<p>
	    Yesterday I went to the Saturday market with Jordan for day game. We walked around a lot until I finally made an approach on these two girls talking on the sidewalk. I told them they looked nice and commented on their matching bags. I talked about the bags for a bit and then excused myself. After this I realized I just need to do this more, no technique analysis needed, simply get comfortable with it. I did one more approach, approaching these girls from behind as they were walking in front of us. I just sayed they looked nice and ejected since they seemed wierded out. Jordan mentioned I should've got in front of them to not startle them and show masculine presence, which makes sense. Jordan approached this girl who ended up being in highschool in front of the PSU engineering building :). 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Jordan and I went to Shake later after daygaming. It took us a while to start approaching. My first approach I approached this girl from behind and asked her why she was so hot. She actually made a few comments back even though she had no interest or ioi's. I'll definitely be using this opener more in the future. For my second approach I asked these two girls dancing why they were so hot again. They seemed to enjoy it and I could've gone further but a guy pulled them away. Before that, I started asking weird questions to be funny, which I might try again. Afterwards there was this girl with a big ass that I wanted to approach. I saw this guy just start grinding on her and she went with it, so I tried the same approach later. I don't like the feel of it, but it seems to work from my observation. I grabbed her waist but didn't make ass to crotch contact. She looked back and smiled, so I was good. We had made prior eye contact as well. I think I'm going to try this in the more meat market type clubs if I get some IOI's from the girl. Asking girls to dance verbally or by sticking my hand out hasn't gotten good responses, even from girls who gave me an IOI. I want to work on more assertive, primal, and non-verbal type of game. I think this is best for clubs. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Jordan saw this girl there that he had almost banged doing gutter game at Shake a few weeks ago. She was pretty hot too, probably 7 or 8/10 looks wise. He had gone to her and her friends house and was about to seal the deal, when the friend shut it down. This night he hesitated to approach, and this other guy ended up dancing with her throughout the night. He did eventually approach, just to say hi and happy birthday. At the end that guy ended up leaving with her, or so it seemed. Jordan realized he should've just said screw it and tried to go for her or fail, and not worry about screwing up.

	    Tuesday I went with my buddy Ronit to a blues festival and fireworks show. Throughout the day I saw many cute girls but hesitated to approach because they were walking in a crowd or dancing. This was during the day and I only had 1 beer so it was more intimidating than a club or bar. In these situations I need to man up and just do it. Also, keeping it simple is key as I'm already nervous and can't think clear. Just saying hi your cute, or commenting on her appearance/making assumptions are the two easiest openers. The point is to just open with something no matter how bad, as it's better than passing it up. Also, I tried keeping eye contact with girls as long as possible and noticed that some would match me. I'm going to keep doing this in clubs. Wait for her to break the contact. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Friday I went to Shake by myself. I took a while to start dancing, looking at my phone and throwing back beers in the meantime. I got some ioi's but chickened out most of the night. I think for a club like Shake, if the girl is dancing then simply saying hi and then grabbing her hand and dancing is the way to go. I'll try this next time. I tried to just grab a girl's waist who was near me and she wasn't into it. I'm going to avoid this unless the girl gives clear ioi's or it works with another guy like last time. My highlight of the night was grinding with this hot black girl. She was dancing with her friends and threw me a few subtle looks. I moved closer to her and she eventually ended up in front of me, facing me. From there I just grabbed her hand, spun her, and started grinding. The last few times I've done this I just say nothing and eventually she leaves. From now on I'm going to try making conversation while dancing. Something like "I think you are trying to seduce me with your moves". Either that or reopen her later, as she is somewhat interested in me.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Saturday I went to Jackies with Ronit. He left after a while and I just rolled solo the rest of the night. I opened 4 girls, in some commenting on their clothing/tattoos and in others jsut saying hi and slipping into have you been here before boring talk. The thing is, that's better than nothing. In those cases I just opened without anything in my mind. I'm going to try a set bar/club opener in these situations so I don't freeze, something that works in all bars/clubs. So the first girl I opened by asking about her tatoos. We talked about common areas for tatoos, most painful areas for them, and worst areas for them. The conversation died off after that. I could've asked how she planned/chose the tattoos and why. I could've assumed she worked in a creative field because of them. I could've assumed she doesn't like me because I don't have tattoos and teased on that. Another thing is there were a few clear ioi's that I failed to act on. Remember, just use a canned opener or say hi, better than nothing.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The second girl I opened by saying her jean jacked looked cool. We talked about the venue and other venues, getting into where I/she lived. Here I could've assumed she worked on a ranch and milked cows. I could've asked why she was in a bar with city-boys. Or simply use a canned opener.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The third girl I opened while she was on her phone. Bad move on my part. The fourth girl I opened by saying hi and moving into boring talk. Here I could've used a canned opener or just said hey your cool I had to say what's up, then maybe tell her I don't know what else to say and reapproach later.

	<p>
	    Yesterday I went to the White Owl and then the Goodfoot. White Owl was pretty quite, nobody on the dancefloor and groups at tables. This was Friday around 10-11:30 so maybe it picks up later.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Scenario 1: At Goodfoot as I entered the dance floor I immeditely noticed a girl in a circle looking back at me frequently. I chickened out but what I should've done is try to make eye contact with a smile. After this, I should most likely move to her side and open her normally. I haven't had luck with dance approaches so I'll limit those, unless it's obvious she wanted to grind for example.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Scenario 2: There were several situations where girls in groups who were dancing were shooting me looks. This situation happens all the time on the dancefloor. I think the way to handle this is to make eye contact with the girl I like, smile, and approach her and open from the side/front (not behind!). I can essentially "join the circle" and even dance with them after opening her. This is tough when she is far away or blocked though. In these situations I can wait until she gets a drink, or just work my way over there.  
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 1: I approached this girl who was off the dance floor alone. I used the "You looking like you're having the most fun" opener and it fit since she looked bored. After this we talked about the music a bit, but I couldn't hear her well so I was just nodding. I should've used some of my canned conversations to keep it more entertaining. She looked uninterested so I left. Shortly after she came over and asked if I wanted her number. She was replying to my texts late at night so I tried to go for the ONS, but she didn't reply after that. I guess with a connection that weak I should've just asked her out on a date. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 2: I approached another girl off the dance floor with the same opener. This opener seems to get decent reception. We talked about the music and dancing again. I talked about how bad dancers need a crowded dance floor to hide and the opposite for good dancers. I should say that I need a crowded dance floor so nobody gets jealous of my skills. For this approach I should've gone into some canned conversations. I ejected and saw her with a guy later so maybe she ahd a bf.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 3: I saw a girl in a group nearby who I think was looking back and getting close. I opened her from behind with a dance approach. She turned it down but seemed interested. For this I should've just done a regular open. Tonight made me realize I need to banish the dance approach for most cases for the time being. I could've also reapproached her.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 4: There was a girl dancing with her friend and getting really close in front of me. I tried to dance open her from behind, and she gave a dirty look. She danced with me seemingly out of pity after that, trying to give tips on how I should dance better. This is my most embarrassing approach to date. I should've opened from the side verablly and possibly joined their dance group afterwards. This approach made me realize I need to STOP APPROACHING FROM BEHIND AND/OR DOING DANCING APPROACHES. Also, if I'm going to approach I need to do I quickly instead of creepily hovering near her. Just use a canned opener and do your best.

	<p>
	    Approach 1: Friday I went to Jackie's with Jordan. The first opener I did was the most fun opener on a group of 2 girls. They didn't ioi me and seemed to be about to leave as I opened. They weren't super receptive and left shortly into the conversation. This was just a case of no interest. 
        </p>
	<p>
	    Approach 2: I approached these 2 girls who were in front and I believe ioi'd me. I used the standard most fun opener and the superficial bar line. This one got the girl laughing when I asked what car she drove. She left after I said her choice wasn't good enough. Here I should've complemented her car choice "that's a sexy car", or just don't make her answer the question and move on after the laugh.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 3: The third approach was on this tall girl who I was lingering around far too long before approaching. Also she didn't show clear ioi's. Here I need to approach in 3 seconds or forget about it.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 4: I approached this girl who I believe ioi'd me. I used the usual opener and topic. She didn't get the car joke and so it fizzled out after that. I think if they don't get the joke I should say "just kidding" about what car they drive. Her friend pulled her away, but she rejoined. It was a sort of dance circle, so I should've just danced with them for a while and maybe reopen later, possibly a dance opener.
	</p>
        <p>
	    Scenario 1: These 3 girls came near me and asked what beer I was drinking. I was interested in one girl but I think the other one was into me. Here I should've gamed the group with verbals or dancing with them. I just let it fizzle.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Scenario 2: This girl ioi'd and opened me by asking if I looked like a certain actor. Her friends pulled her away. I should've tried, here I basically just let her go.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 1: Saturday I went to Holocene with Jordan. He pointed out an ioi of a hot girl that I should've approached. I need to work on just going up and saying whatever within 3 seconds. Anyhow, I approached this HB7 after she gave a few obvious stares. She was receptive to my direct approach and we danced for a while. She had 4 friends and they went to go smoke outside. I should've figure out if she lives close by. If so, go for ONS. If not or she says no, talk to her a bit more and get her number. Also, make sure to kiss her in this scenario.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 2: These 2 girls were eyeing me and Jordan for a while. We should've approached way earlier but finally he approached one and I the other. She seemed kinda 50/50 so I should've tried being more direct and pulling her in, grabbing her waist instead of holding hands while dancing.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Scenario 1: The 4 girls were eyeing me and I think 2 of them were into me. They were HB5 so I wasn't too excited. They actually sat near me and Jordan and talked to us. Not much too learn here.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Scenario 2: This HB6 approached me, danced for a short while, and asked for my IG. I should've tried to pull her in and dance closely while continuing the conversation. SAY ANYTHING to keep it going, no matter how boring. Just ask an open ended question.

	    Approach 1: Last Friday I went to Kasa and then Shake with Vinit and Vipul. For the first approach I had been dancing a while and saw this HB8 smiling and giving me glances from her group of friends. She got approached by a guy who was with her for a bit and then left. I eventually approached and said how are you, why are you so hot. I offered to dance but she didn't react so we talked a bit more. After a while she started dancing with her friend and turned her back to me. I think here I should have been more physical and aggressive. The previous guy was like this and he ended up dancing with her for a bit. So the lesson is to learn what the girl likes by observing other guys who are successful with her. I think this girl was into me and needed an aggressive non-verbal approach where I say hi and start touching early.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 2: I approached this HB7.5, said hi, and asked if she danced. She said no but relented after I stuck out my hands. She was a high energy dancer but I'm not, so I slowed it down. I sped it up later with the beat and she asked "are you for real?". After this we talked a bit. I asked what she does for fun and she mentioned working in a hospital. I should've joked if I get hurt will she take care of me. The convo died later and she left. Here I did fine, I just need better conversation material and skills.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 1: Saturday, Jacob, Ian, his girlfriend Kimberley, and Seph went to Dixie's. The first approach was Seph opening 2 girls who I should've as I think they ioi'd me. I joined the group to talk to a HB7. We talked for a while but they left eventually. Here I should've touched her and teased more. The vibe was too friendly even though I know she was into me. She was actually carrying a good deal of the conversation too and starting it back up when it died. We could've danced of grabbed food (the 4 of us). I should've at least got a number or IG here.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 2: I saw this girl looking back at me and opened with "I'm jealous of your dance moves". We talked for a bit and then she turned her back to me, but she was right in front. I took a risk and grabbed her shoulders, and she started grinding on me. She had to go soon so I got her IG. Here I could've tried to reopen if she didn't leave, or talk to her more before she left, but she might've just wanted to grind and nothing else. She didn't reply to me on IG so I'm inclined to believe the latter.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 3: I opened this HB8 and but her friend pulled her away soon. Later on, Seph was getting along with the cockblock friend. They wanted to get food so me and her friends joined. The friend was teasing me, saying I looked like a serial killer. I kept saying I'm not, but I should've agreed and amplified here. As I was leaving, she apologized. We shook hands and she left her hand for a solid 10 seconds. I tried to get her IG but she told me to yell it as she was walking away, and I wasn't having it. I should mention as I was leaving she seemed disappointed. I should've chatted her up a bit longer as there was some sexual tension there.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Approach 4: I opened this HB6 who was dancing crazy. She was a big time game player. She constantly said "we're not having sex" and wouldn't dance with/on me until I finally started getting physical. I think I played this right in being non-reactive and saying I'm just here to dance, not have ex with her. Also, I was persistent and started getting physical. She needed a dominant personality. We exchanged numbers and she asked me to hang out but I wasn't enthusiastic enough in my reply so she left. I should've pushed for the ons by saying "let's get food/hang out at your place". She lived in Scappoose I think so it would've been tough/inconvienient though.

	<p>
	    This week I first went to Tabor Dance. I had a HB7 ask to dance/makeout with me. She grinded on me for a few seconds and then left. I should've tried to talk with her a bit before she left, but she might've just wanted a quick thrill. I had a second HB7 in a group approach who seemed into me. I talked to her with Vinit about favorite drinks, and she let me try hers. She also shook my hand at the beginning, middle, and end. She seemed to be whispering to her friend about me as well. Here I should've tried to tease/flirt a bit more and I definitely should've taken her number/IG at the end, as this was a clear IOI. The third girl was called over by Ronit and asked for my Snap after chatting with us for a bit. She teased me for not having Snap and asked how old I was. I said 35 to be funny and she left. I should've just said my age, 25, as she was 18. This was another easy number. 
	</p>
        <p>
	    On Thursday me and Vinit chatted these girls outside Coffin Club for a bit. We both left the club and I was afraid to follow them, as I didn't want to look creepy. Vinit said to not care, and we ended up catching up to them and having a mini adventure with them. The lesson is to not care about looking creepy. Also, approaching as a group and getting girls to change venues is fun. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Friday I hit Holocene with friends. I dance approached this one girl with her friend from behind. We danced for a bit and talked some. Eventually she went back to her friend and I got her IG. Here I need to keep her fresh by flirting/talking more, and also asking her to move to a quiet area to talk. Just dancing gets stale after a while and the girl leaves. I also approached this girl in a mixed group on the dancefloor, asking her to dance. She opened up and talked a bit, seeming tempted. I've had this happen before, here I need to go into verbal game and drop the dancing idea. Maybe try to dance later. She wants to talk to me, but not dance. I made hard eye contact with a girl while sitting, and she sat next to me with her friends. It was on, as she was clearly into me, even grabbing my cock after I implied to do so. I asked to hang out and she said she couldn't b/c of her friends. I got her number and she wants to hang out on Saturday. In this situation, I could've tried to pull her to my car.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Saturday I hit Holocene again. I saw two girls dancing and clinked cups with them. After this they seemed to be eyeing me, so I asked them who was gonna dance with me, teasing about which one was better. I like this low key approach and may try it again, instead of starting by asking to dance. This was similar to Friday where the girl left after a while of talking and dancing. I need to move her to a different area or up the flirtation. It's getting stale so she leaves. After we went to Jackies. Here I approached a girl in a group after giving heavy eye contact which was returned. I had a decent chat with some teasing, but it got a bit boring. Here I need spicy conversation to stand out. Also, I could've bounced her to a different area to keep it fresh. A second girl approached me and told me to just go for it and approach a girl. I think she was into me, and I should've spat game at her. Random girls don't approach guys in meat market bars unless they are into them.
