	    So I went to Kasa with Jordan. In the line there were several girls behind me that seemed open to conversation. One was getting close and apologized, 	      the other asked me what the cover was, and later asked for help with the atm. I think the lesson here is to just be social in the line, it doesn't need to be direct but just having a conversation. In the club Jordan opened a girl from behind and she was a bit closed off and startled, but he kept going and she warmed up. The lesson, persist past the initial opener even if she is cold. If she remains cold, eject. I tried to talk to a girl by touching her shoulder but she didn't turn. Jordan told me to talk to her in these situations, she might be shy or not sure if you're just trying to get by. I also had a girl in a mixed group open me by saying it was her friends b-day. I talked to them a bit but ran out of steam. I should've continued the conversation or possibly tried to dance with them since it seemed like they were higher energy. Also, I should've kept to conversation funny and goofy. I need to come up with some go-to funny conversation topics for these situations. Overall, the takeaway is to approach when seeing an ioi quickly, regardless of openers. I got a lot of ioi's and  chickened out.

	    The day before yesterday I went to Holocene solo for the 90s vs 00s dance night. I got many ioi's but just chickened out and danced the whole time. I just wasn't committed and shouldn't have gone out that night.

	    Yesterday I went to the Saturday market with Jordan for day game. We walked around a lot until I finally made an approach on these two girls talking on the sidewalk. I told them they looked nice and commented on their matching bags. I talked about the bags for a bit and then excused myself. After this I realized I just need to do this more, no technique analysis needed, simply get comfortable with it. I did one more approach, approaching these girls from behind as they were walking in front of us. I just sayed they looked nice and ejected since they seemed wierded out. Jordan mentioned I should've got in front of them to not startle them and show masculine presence, which makes sense. Jordan approached this girl who ended up being in highschool in front of the PSU engineering building :).

	    Jordan and I went to Shake later after daygaming. It took us a while to start approaching. My first approach I approached this girl from behind and asked her why she was so hot. She actually made a few comments back even though she had no interest or ioi's. I'll definitely be using this opener more in the future. For my second approach I asked these two girls dancing why they were so hot again. They seemed to enjoy it and I could've gone further but a guy pulled them away. Before that, I started asking weird questions to be funny, which I might try again. Afterwards there was this girl with a big ass that I wanted to approach. I saw this guy just start grinding on her and she went with it, so I tried the same approach later. I don't like the feel of it, but it seems to work from my observation. I grabbed her waist but didn't make ass to crotch contact. She looked back and smiled, so I was good. We had made prior eye contact as well. I think I'm going to try this in the more meat market type clubs if I get some IOI's from the girl. Asking girls to dance verbally or by sticking my hand out hasn't gotten good responses, even from girls who gave me an IOI. I want to work on more assertive, primal, and non-verbal type of game. I think this is best for clubs.

	    Jordan saw this girl there that he had almost banged doing gutter game at Shake a few weeks ago. She was pretty hot too, probably 7 or 8/10 looks wise. He had gone to her and her friends house and was about to seal the deal, when the friend shut it down. This night he hesitated to approach, and this other guy ended up dancing with her throughout the night. He did eventually approach, just to say hi and happy birthday. At the end that guy ended up leaving with her, or so it seemed. Jordan realized he should've just said screw it and tried to go for her or fail, and not worry about screwing up.
