	    So I went to Kasa with Jordan. In the line there were several girls behind me that seemed open to conversation. One was getting close and apologized, 	      the other asked me what the cover was, and later asked for help with the atm. I think the lesson here is to just be social in the line, it doesn't need to be direct but just having a conversation. In the club Jordan opened a girl from behind and she was a bit closed off and startled, but he kept going and she warmed up. The lesson, persist past the initial opener even if she is cold. If she remains cold, eject. I tried to talk to a girl by touching her shoulder but she didn't turn. Jordan told me to talk to her in these situations, she might be shy or not sure if you're just trying to get by. I also had a girl in a mixed group open me by saying it was her friends b-day. I talked to them a bit but ran out of steam. I should've continued the conversation or possibly tried to dance with them since it seemed like they were higher energy. Also, I should've kept to conversation funny and goofy. I need to come up with some go-to funny conversation topics for these situations. Overall, the takeaway is to approach when seeing an ioi quickly, regardless of openers. I got a lot of ioi's and  chickened out.
